        I am Deepak Jain Some people call me  DJ. I am a web developer that
        convert ideas into code.
      </p>
<br/>
      <p>Here i want to share how i came in this coding field</p>
      <p>
        If i start from beginning i done my B.tech from our city college called
        MITRC and choosed stream as computer science.
      </p>

      <p>
        To be honest i was never focused towards coding and all other
        technologies during my B.tech.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        But during corona i started html and css just for timepass. but ‡§ú‡•à‡§∏‡•á
        ‡§ú‡•à‡§∏‡•á i learned these 2 things i thought this will be enought to get a
        job. Then i consult to one of my senior then he told only html css is
        not enough to get a job in web development area. Then he suggested me to
        learn JS.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Then i started and literally in starting phase it was too hard for me to
        understand. I was not able to use a simple Map of JS. but ‡§ß‡•Ä‡§∞‡•á ‡§ß‡•Ä‡§∞‡•á i
        tried and did some small projects ‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ü‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§¨ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ ‡§ï‡•á. And after sometime
        i started React js. and Got an internship in consolebit Technologies.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>Then I got some confidence with the help of my seniors and worked on some big and good clients project.</p>
      <p>And I am still learning daily for up to date in this field</p>
      <br/>
